        "1. What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
        " - A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random experiment. It maps the outcomes of a random process to real numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
        " - There are two main types:\n",
        " - Discrete Random Variable: Takes countable values (e.g., number of students).\n",
        " - Continuous Random Variable: Takes any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
        " - Discrete Distribution: Deals with countable outcomes (e.g., binomial, Poisson).\n",
        " - Continuous Distribution: Deals with infinite possible values within a range (e.g., normal, exponential).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        " - A PDF gives the probability of a random variable taking on a particular value. For continuous variables, it represents the density rather than exact probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDF?\n",
        " - PDF shows the probability density at a specific value.\n",
        " - CDF shows the probability that a variable is less than or equal to a certain value.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        " - A discrete uniform distribution assigns equal probability to a finite number of outcomes.\n",
        "Example: Rolling a fair die (each face has 1/6 probability).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
        " - Only two outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "One trial.\n",

        "ùëù\n",
        "p is the probability of success.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
        " - The binomial distribution models the number of successes in\n",
        "n independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
        "Used in yes/no situations like coin tosses or pass/fail tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        " - The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space when events happen independently.\n",
        "Example: Number of emails received per hour.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        " - A continuous uniform distribution has equal probability for all values within a certain range.\n",
        "PDF is constant across the range.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
        " - Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve.\n",
        " - Mean = Median = Mode.\n",
        " - Defined by mean (Œº) and standard deviation (œÉ).\n",
        " - 68-95-99.7 Rule applies.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
        " - It is a normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.\n",
        " - Important for Z-score calculations and hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in\n",
        "statistics?\n",
        " - CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population‚Äôs distribution.\n",
        " - It's vital for making inferences about populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        " - CLT justifies the use of the normal distribution for the sampling distribution of the mean, even when the population isn‚Äôt normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
        " - Z-statistics help determine whether to reject the null hypothesis by comparing the Z-score with critical values under the standard normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
        " -\n",
        "Z = (X - Œº) / œÉ\n",
        "It shows how many standard deviations a value\n",
        "X is from the mean\n",
        "Œº. Helps in comparing data across different scales.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
        " - Point Estimate: A single value estimate of a parameter (e.g., sample mean).\n",
        " - Interval Estimate: A range (confidence interval) that likely contains the population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        " - They provide a range within which we expect the population parameter to lie with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        " - Z-scores determine the margin of error in confidence intervals.\n",
        " - E.g., for 95% confidence, Z ‚âà 1.96 is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        " - Z-scores standardize different datasets, allowing comparison of values across different distributions by showing their position relative to their means.\n",
